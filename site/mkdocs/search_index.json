They are not used to create models dynamically. So debugging and seeing what is generated is very easy for humans.\n\n\nDocumented,\n\n\nTested,\n\n\nNo Dependencies on generated files,\n\n\nMulti schema support,\n\n\nOne to many relation support (hasMany and belongsTo),\n\n\nMany to many relation support (belongsToMany),\n\n\nInter-schema relation support.

One to many (hasMany), many to one (belongsTo) and many to many (belongsToMany) relations are detected automatically. If two tables are joined via a join table this module detects it automatically and generates many to many sequelize relations. If a table has more than one foreign key, then it is considered join table. In reality it may not be a join table. However it is impossible to detect that.\n\n\nSpecial Case: hasOne\n\n\nIn short: \nhasMany\n relations can be converted to \nhasOne\nrelations manually using \ncustom-data.js\n.\n\n\nDetails: \none to one (hasOne)\n relations does not really bring any design benefits. In fact, it would cause performance overheads to the database engine for having to link the table rows together. The 2 tables can actually be combined into a single table. However Sequelize provides \nhasOne\n type relations. Since there is no way to detect \none to one\n relations automatically, they have to be added manually by using \ncustom data file\n\n\nFor example:\nSuppose Company has many Contacts. To make it one to one relation, below example may be added to \ncustom-data.js\n. Please note \nContact\n key is singular.\n\n\nKey should be singular version of \nhasMany\n aliases. \n\n\nmodule.exports = {\n    Company: {\n        hasOne: {\n            Contact: {}\n        }\n    }\n};\n\n\n\n\nSmart Default Naming of Aliases\n\n\nThis template uses table names or schema table names for model naming. For relations it uses foreign key names and relation names from your database. (You are naming your relations in database meaningfully right?) Default template is based on camelCase naming. You can easily change it to use snake_case or PascalCase by using provided filters. Naming conventions are based on Sequelize module suggestions and generated explicitly with 'as' parameter. Aliases can be turned of by providing a custom options file and setting \ngenerateAliases\n false.\n\n\n module.exports = { generateAliases: false };\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType of Object\n\n\nFilters\n\n\nDefault Naming \n Alias Rule\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntable\n\n\nclassCase\n\n\nTable name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhasMany\n\n\nplural, classCase, stripPrefix(source)\n\n\nRelation name in database. Table name stripped from beginning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbelongsTo\n\n\nsingular, classCase, relationName\n\n\nForeign key column name. If name ends with 'id' or '_id' it will be stripped. Otherwise 'related' is added at the beginning to prevent it from clashing with column name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbelongsToMany\n\n\nplural, classCase, relationName('')\n\n\nJoin table name + foreign key in join table which refers to other table. If name ends with 'id' or '_id' it will be stripped.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs an example for the schema above aliases are created as follows. Please note names of foreign keys in \ncart_line_item\n table: \nproduct_id\n and \ncart\n. To demonstrate different naming rules 'product_id' contains \nid\n suffix while 'cart' not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelation\n\n\nAs\n\n\nWhy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct.hasMany\n\n\nCartLineItems\n\n\nproduct_\ncart_line_items\n: Plural of relation name. Table name is stripped from the beginning of relation name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct.belongsToMany\n\n\nCartLineItemCarts\n\n\ncart_line_item\n + \ncart\n + \ns\n: Plural of join table name + foreign key column in join table referring to other table. '_id' suffix is stripped from column name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCart.belongsToMany\n\n\nCartLineItemProducts\n\n\ncart_line_item\n + \nproduct\n_id\n + \ns\n: Plural of join table name + foreign key column in join table referring to other table. '_id' suffix is stripped from column name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCart.hasMany\n\n\nCartLineItems\n\n\ncart_\ncart_line_items\n: Plural of relation name. Table name is stripped from the beginning of relation name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCartLineItem.belongsTo\n\n\nRelatedCart\n\n\nRelated\n + \ncart\n: Singular of foreign key column prefixed with \n'Related'\n. Otherwise 'Cart' relation and 'cart' column collide in same casing (camelCase, ClassCase etc.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCartLineItem.belongsTo\n\n\nProduct\n\n\nproduct\n_id\n: Singular of foreign key column. Id suffix is stripped from column name. Otherwise 'ProductId' relation and 'product_id' column collide in same casing (camelCase, ClassCase etc.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAQ\n\n\nI have multiple schema with same table names in them. How can I prevent collision of my model names?\n\n\nIn your template;\n\n\n\n\nRename \n'sequelize/table/definition/{table.name}.js.nunj.html'\n as \n'sequelize/table/definition/{table.schema.name}-{table.name}.js.nunj.html'\n.\n\n\nChange \nmodelName macro\n in \n'sequelize/table/definition/{table.schema.name}-{table.name}.js.nunj.html'\n as \n{{ (table.schema.name + table.name) | classCase }}\n.\n\n\nAdd \n'{table.schema.name}-'\n string to \n'sequelize.import'\n and \n'require'\n parts in \n'sequelize/db/index.js.nunj.html'\n file to match new model file's names. \n\n\n\n\nI hate aliases that sequelize template generate. What can I do?\n\n\nYou have three choices. You either do:\n\n\n\n\nDisable aliases all together by creating a file named \noption.js\n (you can use any name) with content as below:\n\n\n\n\nmodule.exports = {\n    generateAliases: false  // This disables aliases all together. See partials/has-many-nunj.html and other relation templates.    \n};\n\n\n\n\nFeed that file to \npgen\n \n\n\n$ pgen exec sequelize-template -d our_crm -u user -p tOpSeCrEt -t model --optionsfile options.js\n\n\n\n\n\nOr use custom aliases for some or all models by creating a file name \ncustom-data.js\n (you can use any name) with similar content as below:\n\n\n\n\nYou can see original and overridden aliases in generated file 'relation-cheatsheet.txt'.\n\n\nAccount: {\n    hasMany: {\n        HasContacts: {                      // This is the default alias should have generated by pgen. \n            as: \n'MyBeautifulAlias'\n        // This is the alias you want. You renamed 'HasContacts' as 'MyBeautifulAlias'\n        }\n    },\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr change alias naming for all tables by changing \nhas-many.nunj.html\n, \nbelongs-to.nunj.html\n, \nbelongs-to-many.nunj.html\n in \npartials\n directory of generated \nsequelize\n template.\n\n\n\n\n*.nunj.html file extension is ugly.\n\n\nThis is not a question. nunj.html extension is chosen because \nnunjucks\n command line tools expect files with extension \nhtml\n. However some IDE's struggle to auto complete/help/color \nnunjucks\n, swig, twig, jinja files with html extension. We can define .nunj.html extension in IDE's to differentiate template files (\n.nunj.html) and html (\n.html) files correctly and make \nnunjucks\n command line tools happy.\n\n\nHowever if you really like to use another file extension in your templates create template filw tih your desired extension and use \n--extension\n option of \npgen\n\n\n$ pgen exec sequelize-template -d our_crm -u user -p tOpSeCrEt -t model --extension html",
