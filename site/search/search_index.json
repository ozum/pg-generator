Reverse engineers PostgreSQL database, Executes nunjucks templates for each table, schema and for database, Makes database objects available to templates using pg-structure . pg-generator takes your burden of manually creating ORM files or any other files which are based on database structure. Installation $ npm install -g pg-generator Sequelize Example See sequelize template for usage and details. $ pgen template sequelize -t sequelize-template $ pgen exec sequelize-template -d our_crm -u user -p tOpSeCrEt -t model --fix First command copies one of the builtin templates (sequelize) into target directory (sequelize-template). Second command generates files based on given template (sequelize-template) into target directory (model). You may change generated templates according to your requirements, also you should add generated templates to your repository . Basic Usage Use pgen template to copy one of the builtin templates or create your own template. (You can use base template for starting up.) Use pgen exec to create files based on your template. You can access CLI options and their description via -h or --help arguments. $ pgen --help $ pgen template --help $ pgen exec --help Template Creating a template from scratch is easy. Execute command below: $ pgen template base -t my-template To see a basic example execute following command from shell and examine files in tutorial-example directory. $ pgen template tutorial -t tutorial-template For a full fledged example which we use at Ozcorp, see Sequelize Example above. For Low Level Direct Access: pg-structure If you prefer lower level methods to directly access PostgreSQL structure to build your own generators. You can check pg-structure module which is used to build this module and provides direct access to database structure.

Usage Create template and model files: $ pgen template sequelize -t sequelize-template $ pgen exec sequelize-template -d our_crm -u user -p tOpSeCrEt -t model In your application, create a sequelize object and initialize models with it: var Sequelize = require('sequelize'); var sequelize = new Sequelize('database', 'user', 'password', { dialect: 'postgres', logging: false }); var model = require('./model/index.js').init(sequelize); // You only need to init once. You can just require later. model.Company.findOne({ where: {id: 1} }) .then(function(company) { console.log(company.name); }) .catch(function(error) { console.log(err.stack); }); After you initialized your model, you shouldn't initialize it again and just require your model like below: var model = require('./model/index.js'); // No init here, because it is initialized before. // Your code here. Features: Generated model files are as similar as possible to official Sequelize documents. Created files are static and transparent. They are not used to create models dynamically. So debugging and seeing what is generated is very easy for humans. Documented, Tested, No Dependencies on generated files, Multi schema support, One to many relation support (hasMany and belongsTo), Many to many relation support (belongsToMany), Inter-schema relation support. (i.e. public.account table to other_schema.cutomer table), Ultimately configurable and customizable by modifying template files, No configuration file to modify, CLI support, Default smart naming of models and relations, Very easy to override auto generated files, Table Specific Configuration. Template Utility Functions Templates have passed a variable called util which provides some useful utilities. type: {{ util.sequelizeType(column) }} - type: DataTypes.INTEGER uniqueRelatedTables(table) \u21d2 Array. pgStructure.table Returns an array of all tables related to this table. Duplicates are removed, so every related table in the result array is unique. Kind : global function Returns : Array. pgStructure.table - - List of related tables. Param Type Description table pgStructure.table pg-structure table to search related tables for. sequelizeType(column) \u21d2 string Returns Sequelize ORM data type for given column. Kind : global function Returns : string - - Sequelize data type. Param Type Description column pgStructure.column pg-structure column object . Example {{ util.sequelizeType() }} // DataTypes.INTEGER(3) {{ sequelizeType('Sequelize') }} // Sequelize.INTEGER(3) Relations Relations are detected automatically. One to many (hasMany), many to one (belongsTo) and many to many (belongsToMany) relations are detected automatically. If two tables are joined via a join table this module detects it automatically and generates many to many sequelize relations. If a table has more than one foreign key, then it is considered join table. In reality it may not be a join table. However it is impossible to detect that. Special Case: hasOne In short: hasMany relations can be converted to hasOne relations manually using custom-data.js . Details: one to one (hasOne) relations does not really bring any design benefits. In fact, it would cause performance overheads to the database engine for having to link the table rows together. The 2 tables can actually be combined into a single table. However Sequelize provides hasOne type relations. Since there is no way to detect one to one relations automatically, they have to be added manually by using custom data file For example: Suppose Company has many Contacts. To make it one to one relation, below example may be added to custom-data.js . Please note Contact key is singular. Key should be singular version of hasMany aliases. module.exports = { Company: { hasOne: { Contact: {} } } }; Smart Default Naming of Aliases This template uses table names or schema table names for model naming. For relations it uses foreign key names and relation names from your database. (You are naming your relations in database meaningfully right?) Default template is based on camelCase naming. You can easily change it to use snake_case or PascalCase by using provided filters. Naming conventions are based on Sequelize module suggestions and generated explicitly with 'as' parameter.

Id suffix is stripped from column name. Otherwise 'ProductId' relation and 'product_id' column collide in same casing (camelCase, ClassCase etc.) FAQ I have multiple schema with same table names in them. How can I prevent collision of my model names? In your template; Rename 'sequelize/table/definition/{table.name}.js.nunj.html' as 'sequelize/table/definition/{table.schema.name}-{table.name}.js.nunj.html' . Change modelName macro in 'sequelize/table/definition/{table.schema.name}-{table.name}.js.nunj.html' as {{ (table.schema.name + table.name) | classCase }} . Add '{table.schema.name}-' string to 'sequelize.import' and 'require' parts in 'sequelize/db/index.js.nunj.html' file to match new model file's names. I hate aliases that sequelize template generate. What can I do? You have three choices. You either do: Disable aliases all together by creating a file named option.js (you can use any name) with content as below: module.exports = { generateAliases: false // This disables aliases all together. See partials/has-many-nunj.html and other relation templates. }; Feed that file to pgen $ pgen exec sequelize-template -d our_crm -u user -p tOpSeCrEt -t model --optionsfile options.js Or use custom aliases for some or all models by creating a file name custom-data.js (you can use any name) with similar content as below: You can see original and overridden aliases in generated file 'relation-cheatsheet.txt'. Account: { hasMany: { HasContacts: { // This is the default alias should have generated by pgen. as: 'MyBeautifulAlias' // This is the alias you want. You renamed 'HasContacts' as 'MyBeautifulAlias' } }, Or change alias naming for all tables by changing has-many.nunj.html , belongs-to.nunj.html , belongs-to-many.nunj.html in partials directory of generated sequelize template. *.nunj.html file extension is ugly. This is not a question. nunj.html extension is chosen because nunjucks command line tools expect files with extension html . However some IDE's struggle to auto complete/help/color nunjucks , swig, twig, jinja files with html extension. We can define .nunj.html extension in IDE's to differentiate template files ( .nunj.html) and html ( .html) files correctly and make nunjucks command line tools happy. However if you really like to use another file extension in your templates create template filw tih your desired extension and use --extension option of pgen $ pgen exec sequelize-template -d our_crm -u user -p tOpSeCrEt -t model --extension html","title":"Sequelize"},{"location":"builtin-templates/Sequelize/#usage","text":"Create template and model files: $ pgen template sequelize -t sequelize-template $ pgen exec sequelize-template -d our_crm -u user -p tOpSeCrEt -t model In your application, create a sequelize object and initialize models with it: var Sequelize = require('sequelize'); var sequelize = new Sequelize('database', 'user', 'password', { dialect: 'postgres', logging: false }); var model = require('./model/index.js').init(sequelize); // You only need to init once.
