# Template Based Scaffolding for PostgreSQL 

<div style="font-size:1.4em; color:#444466; margin-bottom:15px;"><strong><a href="http://www.pg-generator.com">pg-generator</a></strong> is a command line utility which generates files for each table and schema of a PostgreSQL database.</div>

 * Reverse engineers PostgreSQL database,
 * Executes [nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) templates for each table, schema and for database,
 * Makes database objects available to templates using [pg-structure](http://www.pg-structure.com).

[pg-generator](http://www.pg-generator.com) takes your burden of manually creating ORM files or any other files which are based on database structure.

## Installation

    $ npm install -g pg-generator

## Sequelize Example

See [sequelize template](http://www.pg-generator.com/builtin-templates/sequelize/) for usage and details.

    $ pgen template sequelize -t sequelize-template
    $ pgen exec sequelize-template -d our_crm -u user -p tOpSeCrEt -t model --fix

First command copies one of the builtin templates (sequelize) into target directory (sequelize-template). Second command generates files based on given template (sequelize-template) into target directory (model).  

You may change generated templates according to your requirements, also **you should add generated templates to your repository**.

## Basic Usage

1. Use `pgen template` to copy one of the builtin templates or create your own template. (You can use base template for starting up.)
1. Use `pgen exec` to create files based on your template.

You can access CLI options and their description via `-h` or `--help` arguments.

    $ pgen --help
    $ pgen template --help
    $ pgen exec --help

## Template

Creating a template from scratch is easy. Execute command below:

    $ pgen template base -t my-template

To see a basic example execute following command from shell and examine files in tutorial-example directory. 

    $ pgen template tutorial -t tutorial-template
    
For a full fledged example which we use at Ozcorp, see Sequelize Example above. 

## For Low Level Direct Access: [pg-structure](http://www.pg-structure.com)
    
If you prefer lower level methods to directly access PostgreSQL structure to build your own generators. You can check [pg-structure](http://www.pg-structure.com) module which is used to build this module and provides direct access to database structure.
