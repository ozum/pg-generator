# Templates

pg-generator uses templates to generate files. A pg-generator template is a directory containing some special named directories and [nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) files.

Developers can use one of the pg-generator's builtin templates or create or modify templates according to their needs.
