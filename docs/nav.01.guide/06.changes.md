# Changes

pg-generator is rewritten from scratch using TypeScript. The primary target of the new version is to make it simpler to use than the previous version is. The secondary target is making the generators (templates) easier to share using npm. As a result, major changes have been necessary.

## Breaking Changes for Template Developers

- Template file structure needs to be changed.
- Templates need modifications.
- Custom data and options files are merged into a single file.
- Uses pg-structure v7. See [v7 API](https://www.pg-structure.com/nav.02.api/) for details. The most notable change is `array` attribute is not needed (e.g. use `tables` instead of `tables.array`)

| Old Name         | New Name     | Workload |
| ---------------- | ------------ | -------- |
| Templates        | Generators   | Light    |
| Custom Data File | Context File | Moderate |
| Options File     | Context File | Moderate |

## Breaking Changes for Users

- In the previous version templates are bundled with the library and hard to copy and modify for users. The new version does not provide built-in generators. Please install for `pg-generator-example` package from npm for example generators. Modify according to your needs and publish your generators.
- CLI tool was unnecessarily complex and have not so useful features for the majority of the users. New CLI is written from scratch and does not have interactive features anymore.
