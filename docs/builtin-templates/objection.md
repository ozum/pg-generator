# ALPHA STAGE

This template is in alpha stage. Feedback needed.

## Usage

Create template and model files:

    $ pgen template objection-alpha -t objection-alpha-template
    $ pgen exec objection-alpha-template -d our_crm -u user -p tOpSeCrEt -t model

In your application:

```js
const knex = require("knex");
const { model, init } = require("./model/index");

const credentials = {
  client: "pg",
  connection: {
    host: "localhost",
    user: "user",
    password: "password",
    database: "my_database"
  }
};

init(knex(credentials));

model.Company.query()
  .then(function(companies) {
    console.log(companies[0].name);
  })
  .catch(function(error) {
    console.log(error.stack);
  });
```

## Features & Targets (Some are not implemented yet):

* Generated model files are as similar as possible to official Objection documents.
* Created files are static and transparent. They are not used to create models dynamically. So debugging and seeing what is generated is very easy for humans.
* Documented,
* Tested,
* No Dependencies on generated files,
* Multi schema support,
* One to many relation support (hasMany and belongsTo),
* Many to many relation support (belongsToMany),
* Inter-schema relation support. (i.e. public.account table to other_schema.cutomer table),
* Default smart naming of models and relations,
* Very easy to override auto generated files,
